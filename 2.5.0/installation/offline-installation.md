{% callout type="warning" title="Prepare your host system / VM" %}
Before starting the installation, please make sure that your target system meets the [Technical Requirements](technical-requirements.md) and the installation is **performed by a person with basic Linux skills**.
{% /callout %}

{% callout title="Info" %}
This page is applicable to both **clean installations** and **upgrade installations**! The exact same steps should be executed in both cases, no additional configuration is needed for upgrade installs.
{% /callout %}

To install MetaDefender Sandbox on an offline system without an Internet connection, it is necessary to **prepare the offline installation assets** on an **online computer** or virtual machine running **Ubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu 24.04 or** **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 or Rocky Linux 9.5**.

After the preparation step is completed, the offline installation can be performed on multiple offline systems by copying the pre-built assets to the target systems.

Due to legal reasons, the full offline installation package cannot be downloaded directly from [my.opswat.com](my.opswat.com).

## Phase 1 - Preparing Assets for Offline Installation (Online System)

An **online system** running Ubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu 24.04 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 or Rocky Linux 9.5 is required for Phase 1.

{% callout type="error" title="Warning" %}
You must use the **same operating system version** on the **online system (Phase 1)** and the **offline system (Phase 2)**. The offline installation will fail otherwise.
{% /callout %}

This system can be a physical computer or a (temporary) virtual machine. It can also be decommissioned after the installation assets are prepared and copied.

{% callout type="error" title="Warning - Potential loss of data and system packages installed" %}
If you prepare the offline installation assets on a system with an **existing MetaDefender Sandbox installation**, you might lose all data from that installation!

Note that preparing the offline installation assets will **not** create a functioning Sandbox deployment, and it will install some packages on the system (e.g. Docker and 7-zip).

The installer performs the following steps when preparing the offline assets:

1. Check if the specified `sandbox` user and the sandbox installation folder exist. These are created automatically if needed. See `install.cfg` and [Installation Options](quick-installation/installation-options.md)
2. Install 7-zip and unpack the Sandbox release archive (by default to `/home/sandbox/sandbox`)
3. Install and configure Docker
4. Build and save Docker images using the unpacked assets and config files
5. Download required APT packages and all their dependencies, then prepare an APT package index for offline usage (currently installed packages are upgraded to the latest version)
6. Copy all required files to the `offline-assets` subfolder (which should be copied to the target system)
{% /callout %}

**Step #1 - Download and unpack the release archive**

Download the release archive from [https://my.opswat.com/portal/products](https://my.opswat.com/portal/products)  and copy it to the online system.

Note that the release archive is password protected and needs to be unpacked.

{% callout title="Info" %}
Please use the **password** that you received from your OPSWAT support!

Please adjust the x.y.z **version numbers** to match the downloaded filename.
{% /callout %}

### Ubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu 24.04

Install the required dependencies and unpack the release archive as follows:

{% code %}
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full multitail libslang2 -y
7za x -aoa -p"PASSWORD" MetaDefender_Sandbox_vx.y.z-Standalone.zip
```
{% /code %}

### Red Hat 9.5 or Rocky Linux 9.5

Install the required dependencies and unpack the release archive as follows:

{% code %}
```bash
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm -y
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install p7zip -y
7za x -aoa -p"PASSWORD" MetaDefender_Sandbox_vx.y.z-Standalone.zip
```
{% /code %}

## Installation

**Step #2 - Move to the installation folder and run the install script**

Note that this operation can take up to 20-30 minutes (depending on available network bandwidth).

The necessary assets will be collected in the `offline-assets`  subfolder within `sandbox-installer` .

{% code %}
```bash
cd sandbox-installer
sudo ./install.sh --prepare-offline
```
{% /code %}

If your system does not meet the system requirements, you can consider using the `--unsafe`  option to bypass the requirements check. In this case, the installation might fail or it could take more time.

The absolute minimum requirement is having 20 GB free disk space.

{% code %}
```bash
sudo ./install.sh --prepare-offline --unsafe
```
{% /code %}

**Step #3 - Copy the installation assets to a portable storage device**

After a successful run, please copy the entire `sandbox-installer`  folder to an external storage device (e.g. USB stick, portable hard drive) with at least 10 GB free space.

First of all, connect your USB device and check its mount point (by default, Ubuntu mounts removable media at `/media/<username>/<name of USB Device>` ):

{% code %}
```bash
ls -l /media/$USER

Example output:
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 8 myuser myuser 4096 Jan  1  1970 MY-FLASH-DRIVE

Example mount point:
/media/myuser/MY-FLASH-DRIVE
```
{% /code %}

After that, you can use the following command to copy the entire `sandbox-installer` folder to the mounted USB drive (optionally, you can create a tarball instead of copying the folder itself):

{% code %}
```bash
mkdir /media/myuser/MY-FLASH-DRIVE/sandbox-installer
cp -rpv . /media/myuser/MY-FLASH-DRIVE/sandbox-installer/
```
{% /code %}

You need to carry this storage device to the offline system(s) where you wish to install Sandbox.

Of course, if you have **other means** to transfer this folder to your offline system, feel free to use that approach!

**Optionally**, you can call `uninstall.sh` if you prefer to remove all files that were created during the installation process. This script will **purge all existing Docker images**, but it will **not** uninstall Docker or other system packages.

{% code %}
```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```
{% /code %}

## Phase 2 - Running Offline Installation (Offline System)

Please prepare an **offline system** running Ubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu 24.04 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 or Rocky Linux 9.5.

The "**minimized**" version of Ubuntu Server is NOT suitable for **offline installations**, since it lacks some essential packages. Please select "Ubuntu Server" when you install the OS:

{% image url="https://uploads.developerhub.io/prod/XX2D/09fvm5ggi4uribl6578dqrhrvve5sv4vd9j7eegt3fjgi75kumjfea18c1ltc79m.png" /%}

**Step #1 -** **Copy the sandbox-installer folder to the offline system**

Please copy the installation assets that you prepared in Phase 1 to the offline system where MetaDefender Sandbox should be installed.

If you transfer the files using a USB drive, please connect that device to the offline system and determine its mount point following the suggestions in the previous section.

After that, you can copy the sandbox-installer to your home folder like this (feel free to choose any target directory):

{% code %}
```bash
cp -rpv /media/myuser/MY-FLASH-DRIVE/sandbox-installer ~
```
{% /code %}

**Step #2 - (Optional) Fix permissions on the** **opswat-sandbox-packages directory**

If you are installing Sandbox on a system with **CIS Level 1 or Level 2 hardening**, it is required to create the `opswat-sandbox-packages` directory **before** the installation and set the necessary permissions:

(This step is only needed on hardened systems)

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/opswat-sandbox-packages
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/opswat-sandbox-packages
```

**Step #3 - Move to the installation folder and run the install script**

Note that this operation can take up to 10-15 minutes (depending on the available system resources).

{% code %}
```bash
cd sandbox-installer
sudo ./install.sh --offline
```
{% /code %}

**Step #4 - Access the Sandbox web server ([https://localhost:443](https://localhost:443)) and setup the initial Admin user**

**Step #5 - Perform Offline Activation**

Please follow the Offline Activation instructions on the [License Activation](license-activation.md) page.

**Step #6 - Scan your preferred test file to check if the Sandbox system functions properly**

**Step #7 - (Optional) Troubleshooting if the Sandbox service failed to** **initialize**

Verify the status of the `sandbox`  service and if the running docker container are healthy:

{% code %}
```bash
sudo service sandbox status
sudo docker ps
```
{% /code %}

The `sblog` bash command can be used to check the application logs for different system components.

This command is available to all users (but might require sudo privileges):

{% code %}
```bash
# Show logs from the transform component
sblog 
# Show logs from the broker component
sblog -b
```
{% /code %}
