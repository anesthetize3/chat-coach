## Overview

**Prevalence Search** provides context about **how common an Indicator of Compromise (IOC)** (e.g., IP/hash/domain) has been observed across available data sources. This helps quickly determine whether an IOC is **rare** (potentially more suspicious) or **widely seen** (often common infrastructure) and supports faster triage during investigations.

In the results table, **Prevalence** appears as one or more count badges (for example `10+`), representing observed frequency across one or multiple prevalence sources/counters.

Note: Prevalence is a **reputation/enrichment signal**. It is not a standalone proof of benign or malicious activity.

Prevalence Search results are displayed in IOC result tables (example: **IPs**) alongside other enrichment fields:

- **IOC**: the indicator value (e.g., IP address)
- **Location**: geolocation context (if available)
- **For domain**: domain context if the IOC was derived from a domain resolution step
- **Prevalence**: occurrence counts (how common the IOC is)
- **OSINT**: open-source intelligence availability/links (if provided)
- **Verdict**: classification outcome shown for the IOC (e.g., confirmed threat/low risk/no threat detected depending on your system’s verdict model)

## Key Capabilities

Prevalence Search operates as a pivot point during malware analysis. Its primary functions include:

- **Contextual Analysis:** Identifies other reports that share the same IOCs (Hashes, IPs, Domains, URLs) within a specified time frame.
- **Infrastructure Reuse Hunting:** Pivots from a single sample to an adversary's broader toolset by finding overlapping network artifacts.
- **Campaign Clustering:** Correlates novel samples with historical data to anchor them to known malware families even when file hashes differ.
- **OSINT Integration:** Cross-references internal prevalence data with external Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to validate threat severity.

## The Impact on Verdict Scoring

The final verdict is an aggregation of evidence from multiple layers. Prevalence influences this through three primary mechanisms:

### A. High Prevalence = Noise Reduction

If suspicious behavior is detected (e.g., a process injecting code) but the associated file hash has a **very high prevalence** in clean environments (seen in 1,000+ reports with "Clean" verdicts), the system may downgrade the threat level.

- **Result:** Prevents false positives caused by common administrative tools or legitimate system updates that behave like malware.

### B. Low Prevalence = Targeted/Zero-Day Alert

A sample with **very low prevalence** (seen in \< 3 reports) that triggers "High Risk" behavioral indicators is flagged with much higher confidence as a **Zero-Day** or **Targeted Attack**.

- **Result:** Escalates the verdict from "High Risk" to "Confirmed Threat" because the lack of global presence suggests a bespoke payload.

### C. Cluster-Based Verdicts

Even if a specific file hash is new, if its **fuzzy hash** (imphash or ssdeep) has high prevalence in reports already marked as "Malicious," the new file inherits that reputation.

- **Result:** The verdict is "Confirmed Threat" via family attribution, even without a perfect signature match.

## The "Verdict Pivot" in the UI

In the MetaDefender Aether report, the prevalence data is typically located next to the IOCs. If an analyst sees a "Neutral" verdict but notices a prevalence of "1" for a suspicious IP, they can manually pivot:

1. **Click the Prevalence Count:** See the 1 other report where this appeared.
2. **Compare Verdicts:** If that 1 report was a "Confirmed Threat," the analyst can manually override the current session's verdict.
3. **Graph Analysis:** Use the Threat Graph to see if both reports share the same C2 infrastructure.

> **Pro Tip:** In the MetaDefender Aether 3.0 pipeline, prevalence is automatically correlated with the **Threat Scoring** layer to reduce alert fatigue, ensuring SOC teams only see unified, high-confidence verdicts.
