### MetaDefender Aether™ 3.0.0 (including MetaDefender Sandbox™ capabilities)

We are excited to announce **MetaDefender Aether 3.0.0**, OPSWAT’s next-generation unified zero-day detection solution. With this release, the proven **MetaDefender Sandbox dynamic analysis engine is now fully integrated into MetaDefender Aether as Layer 2**, strengthening Aether’s multi-layered detection architecture and delivering deeper, faster, and more scalable threat analysis at the perimeter.

MetaDefender Aether combines **Threat Reputation (Layer 1), Dynamic Analysis via emulation-based sandboxing (Layer 2), and Threat Scoring (Layer 3), and Threat Hunting (Layer 4)** into a single, cohesive solution. This unified approach enables organizations to detect and block known, unknown, and zero-day threats across files, URLs, and IPs before they enter the environment.

#### What This Means for MetaDefender Sandbox Customers

MetaDefender Sandbox remains available as a standalone product for customers whose needs are met by a dedicated sandbox solution. However, going forward:

- **All MetaDefender Sandbox capabilities are included within MetaDefender Aether as part of its Layer 2 Dynamic Analysis**
- **MetaDefender Sandbox release updates will also be reflected within MetaDefender Aether release communications**
- Customers upgrading to Aether gain sandbox capabilities plus additional layers of threat intelligence, correlation, and hunting that are not available in a standalone sandbox deployment

#### Why OPSWAT Integrated MetaDefender Sandbox into MetaDefender Aether

The threat landscape has evolved beyond what isolated dynamic analysis tools can efficiently address. While sandboxing remains critical, modern security teams face challenges related to **alert fatigue, false positives, performance bottlenecks, and the need to analyze all files at scale.**

OPSWAT evolved MetaDefender Sandbox into a unified MetaDefender Aether architecture to deliver:

- **Higher accuracy over time** through continuously updated, built-in Threat Intelligence
- **Faster detection and response** without the latency of traditional VM-based sandboxes
- **Reduced false positives** through threat scoring, correlation, and contextual enrichment
- **Operational efficiency** by eliminating the need to deploy and manage multiple disconnected tools

By embedding emulation-based dynamic analysis within MetaDefender Aether, OPSWAT enables sandbox verdicts to be immediately enriched with reputation data, historical intelligence, and cross-signal correlation, providing SOC analysts with clearer, more actionable results.

#### Key Benefits of MetaDefender Aether

Organizations adopting MetaDefender Aether benefit from:

- **99.9% zero-day detection efficacy** - Best-in-class file verdicts driven by multi-layer analysis, real-time threat intelligence, and advanced emulation
- **Up to 20× faster file analysis than traditional sandboxes** - Emulation-based dynamic analysis delivers high-fidelity results without the performance penalties of VM-based sandboxing.
- **Massive file volume handling at the perimeter** - MetaDefender Aether is designed to sit at the edge of the organization, inspecting all inbound and outbound files without slowing business operations.

#### MetaDefender Aether: Built for Modern SOCs \& Analysts

With a redesigned, intuitive user interface, MetaDefender Aether provides security teams with **clear insights, comprehensive reports, and prioritized threat scoring**, helping analysts focus on what matters most. By correlating sandbox findings with live threat intelligence and historical attack data, MetaDefender Aether reduces noise, accelerates investigations, and improves decision-making across SOC and threat hunting teams.

#### Next Steps to Upgrade

Customers currently using MetaDefender Sandbox can upgrade to MetaDefender Aether to unlock a unified, multi-layered zero-day detection platform while retaining familiar sandbox capabilities. To discuss upgrade options or transition planning, please contact your OPSWAT representative.

MetaDefender Aether represents OPSWAT’s vision for the future of zero-day detection: **faster, more accurate, and built to scale, without compromise.**

## MetaDefender Aether 3.0.0 Release Notes

The redesigned MetaDefender Aether UI represents a fundamental shift **from a standalone sandbox interface to a unified zero-day detection solution**. Instead of focusing solely on detonation results, the interface is structured around **the full detection lifecycle.**

From the moment a file is opened, analysts see a clear verdict, behavioral tags, and a transparent view of how reputation, emulation-based analysis, threat scoring, and threat hunting contributed to the decision.

Beyond faster understanding, the new design is optimized for real SOC workflows. The result is an interface that reduces cognitive load and accelerates triage and response.

### Improvements

**Improved Brand Spoofing Detection Accuracy** - The brand detection model has been retrained to significantly reduce false positives, resulting in more reliable phishing identification.

**Simplified and Enhanced OSINT Lookups** - OSINT lookups were simplified and local reputation results are now visible in the OSINT results as OFFLINE\_REPUTATION

**IOC Skip List Migration** - Moved the IOC skip list (allow/blocklist) from the local application database to the separated detection database package to enable frequent updates

**Trends Page MITRE Landscape Table Enhancements** - Color legends have been added to clarify ranking categories and the table has been ordered according to the correct attack timeline.

**Proxy Support for Self-Signed Certificates** - Documented and enabled the addition of CA certificates to Docker containers to support installations behind proxies using self-signed certificates.

**Legacy API Endpoint Removal** - Deprecated legacy API endpoints have been removed

**Core Component Hardening** - Hardened core components with additional security safeguards to strengthen the overall defense posture.

**Batch File-Type Detection** - Enhanced to improve accuracy across complex payloads.

**QR Code Detection Improvements** - Improved to allow the scanning of rendered images in documents and emails

### Bug fixes

**Improved Background Job Reliability -** Refactored database and storage maintenance tasks to prevent job interruptions. The database cleanup job ("Delete reports marked for deletion from db") is now split into independent MongoDB and ArangoDB processes for better performance, and the  cleanup jobs are more resilient to `FileNotFoundError` and `AQLQueryExecuteError` exceptions.

**Advanced Search Special Characters -** Fixed issues where Advanced Search failed or returned no results when queries contained trademark symbols or Unicode characters.

**Report Generation Latency** - Resolved performance bottlenecks that had been causing report generation to take excessively long, restoring timely delivery of reports.
