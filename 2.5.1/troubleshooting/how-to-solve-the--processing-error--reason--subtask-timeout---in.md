**Issue**: Customers may encounter the following error during file analysis in MetaDefender Sandbox:

*Processing error (reason: subtask\_timeout)*

Root Cause: This error typically occurs when the Sandbox's timeout settings are too low to accommodate the full execution of analysis tasks. Specifically, the REPORT\_INTERRUPT\_TIMEOUT parameter is set too short, causing the system to interrupt the report generation prematurely.

**Resolution**:

To fix this issue increase the value of the REPORT\_INTERRUPT\_TIMEOUT parameter. This change allows the Sandbox more time to complete its processing tasks before timing out.

Please see additional details about these parameters in the link below:
