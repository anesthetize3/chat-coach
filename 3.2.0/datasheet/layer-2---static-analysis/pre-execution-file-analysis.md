**Predictive Alin AI** performs file analysis before execution to estimate malicious intent early in the inspection workflow. This supports earlier policy decisions (allow, block, quarantine, or escalate) and reduces dependency on post-execution detection stages.

The analysis is static and structure-driven. Instead of waiting for runtime behavior, the engine evaluates representative file characteristics that are correlated with malicious or evasive patterns.

Pre-execution analysis evaluates file structure and metadata to estimate intent before any code runs.

## Executable analysis

For executable formats, analysis focuses on structural and metadata signals that indicate code quality, packing behavior, and anomaly patterns. Representative features include:

- Section layout consistency, section count, and section naming patterns
- Header and metadata integrity, including malformed or unusual field combinations
- Import and export table characteristics, including suspicious API concentration patterns
- Entropy distribution across sections, which can indicate packing or obfuscation behavior
- Entry point and control-flow related structural indicators
- Resource and embedded object composition patterns
- String and token-level structural distributions at a high level

## PDF analysis

For PDF files, analysis focuses on document structure, object relationships, and indicators commonly associated with malicious document delivery. Representative features include:

- Object graph complexity and unusual object relationship patterns
- Cross-reference and trailer consistency checks
- Embedded stream and object characteristics (including compression and encoding usage patterns)
- JavaScript-related object presence and structural context
- Action and annotation structures associated with redirection or execution workflows
- Embedded file and launch-related object indicators
- Metadata and document structure anomalies

## Why this matters

By evaluating these structural signals pre-execution, Predictive Alin AI improves detection coverage for previously unseen and structurally modified threats while preserving throughput for enterprise file pipelines.
