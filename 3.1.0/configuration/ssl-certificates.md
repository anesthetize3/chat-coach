**MetaDefender Sandbox** (previously known as OPSWAT Filescan Sandbox) uses the **NGINX** web server and its configuration is defined in `/srv/backend/nginx/conf/production/default.conf`

{% callout type="warning" title="Warning" %}
Any modifications to `/srv/backend/nginx/conf/production/default.conf` will be **overwritten if you upgrade** your Sandbox installation!

Always **create a backup** of this file if you modify it!

Alternatively, choose a solution below that does not require modifications to this file!
{% /callout %}

The following self-signed certificate and key files are used by default:

```
ssl_certificate /app/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /app/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.key;
```

The `/app/nginx/certs` path only exists within the Sandbox docker containers, and the corresponding files are actually located in `/home/sandbox/sandbox/webservice/nginx/certs` (the path might differ if you installed Sandbox to a different target directory).

It is possible to modify the configuration to point to your certificate and key files, but it is **recommended to overwrite** the self-signed certificate and key with your own files instead! If you do that, **you can upgrade Sandbox without losing these settings.**

Please create a backup of the self-signed certificate and key files first:

{% code %}
```bash
sudo su sandbox
cd /home/sandbox/sandbox/webservice/nginx/certs
sudo mv nginx-selfsigned.crt nginx-selfsigned-BACKUP.crt
sudo mv nginx-selfsigned.key nginx-selfsigned-BACKUP.key
```
{% /code %}

Then overwrite these files with your **full certificate chain and private key files in PEM format** (the original file extension does not matter). For example, if your custom files are located in `~/my.domain.com` :

{% code %}
```bash
sudo cp ~/my.domain.com/fullchain.pem /home/sandbox/sandbox/webservice/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
sudo cp ~/my.domain.com/privkey.pem /home/sandbox/sandbox/webservice/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.key
```
{% /code %}

Make sure that the certificate is readable by all users and the private key is owned by your `sandbox` user:

{% code %}
```bash
sudo chmod a+r /home/sandbox/sandbox/webservice/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
sudo chown sandbox:sandbox /home/sandbox/sandbox/webservice/nginx/certs/nginx-selfsigned.key
```
{% /code %}

After these preparations, please restart the Sandbox webservice (this should only take a minute):

{% code %}
```bash
/home/sandbox/sandbox/stop_sandbox.sh
/home/sandbox/sandbox/start_sandbox.sh
```
{% /code %}

At this point, you should be able to reach your Sandbox instance at `https://my.domain.com` on port 443.

### Special considerations for private key files with a passphrase

NGINX also supports PEM private key files that require a passphrase to use.

In this case, the `ssl_password_file` option should be added in `/srv/backend/nginx/conf/production/default.conf` as described in the [NGINX documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_password_file)

For example:

{% code %}
```bash
ssl_password_file /etc/keys/global.pass;
```
{% /code %}

As the `default.conf` file must be changed for this, it is strongly encouraged to create a **backup** of this file **before you upgrade Sandbox**!
